### Hi there 👋 My name is Carolina! 🙋‍♀️
 I am new to Java, that is what I will be learning this year. 
 I do have some basic knowledge in Python and R-Programming.

 My favorite subjects in school are chemistry 🧪 and mathematics ➗!

 🧠 Some of my interests include nuerology and psychology; I hope to find ways to incorporate these interests into future coding projects!
